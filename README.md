# React Native FlatList Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a common performance problem in React Native applications when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset. The issue arises from the inefficient rendering of a significant number of items, leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness.

## Problem Description

When rendering a large number of items in a `FlatList`, without proper optimization, React Native struggles to handle the rendering process. This results in performance degradation and potential crashes.  The specific error message may vary, but it often points towards rendering limitations.

## Solution

The solution involves using one or more of the following optimization techniques:

1. **`keyExtractor`:**  A `keyExtractor` function is crucial for `FlatList` performance. It ensures that React Native efficiently updates only the necessary items when data changes, instead of re-rendering the entire list.
2. **`getItemLayout`:**  Using `getItemLayout` provides React Native with pre-calculated dimensions of list items.  This significantly improves scrolling performance, especially for lists with consistent item heights.
3. **Virtualization Techniques:** Consider using libraries that offer virtualization features, which further improve rendering efficiency by only rendering the visible items on the screen.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to resolve the issue using these optimization techniques.
