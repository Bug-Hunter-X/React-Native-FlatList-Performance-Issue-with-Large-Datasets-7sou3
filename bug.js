This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render a large number of items.  The error message itself might vary, but it generally indicates that the list is trying to render more items than it should, leading to performance issues and crashes.  This is often linked to improper use of `keyExtractor`, `getItemLayout`, or missing optimization techniques.

```javascript
// Example code demonstrating the problem (simplified):
<FlatList
  data={largeArray}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
/>
```

This code, without optimization, will struggle if `largeArray` is very long.
